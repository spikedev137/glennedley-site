<p>Updated regularly. Inspired by Derek Sivers and <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a>.</p>

<h2>SPIKE</h2>
<p>Taking on new done-for-you email marketing clients. This is year 20 at <a href="https://spike.co.nz" target="_blank">spike.co.nz</a>.</p>

<h2>RACER PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>I’m the Head of Marketing at Racer Products. My role covers our three main brands: <a href="https://racerproducts.co.nz" target="_blank">racerproducts.co.nz</a>, <a href="https://scarles.co.nz" target="_blank">scarles.co.nz</a> and <a href="https://mudstuck.co.nz" target="_blank">mudstuck.co.nz</a>.</p>
              
<h2>THE BOOK</h2>
<p>The book I co-wrote with best-selling author and Psychology Coach Charles Donoghue, <em>Light Your Own Fire</em>, is published. Charles and I spent 12 months putting this together from the best of both of our writing. Alison Rowe, winner of both the Boston Marathon and New York City Marathon in the same year, wrote a fantastic endorsement for us.</p>
<p>You can buy it from Amazon now: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Light-your-own-fire-purpose-ebook/dp/B09Z7KP7NQ/" target="_blank">Light Your Own Fire</a></p>

<h2>WRITING</h2>
<p>I’ve been kickstarting people’s thinking with the MondayMotivator for over 18 years. <a href="https://www.spike.co.nz/mondaymotivator" target="_blank">Sign up here</a></p>

<h2>READING</h2>
<p>I read two amazing books that changed my mind on trees and New Zealand history. Well worth your time:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Overstory: A Novel</em> by Richard Powers</li>
  <li><em>Tupaia: The Remarkable Story Of Captain Cook’s Polynesian Navigator</em> by Joan Druett</li>
</ul>

<h2>FITNESS</h2>
<p>I’m working on <a href="https://spike.co.nz/becoming-a-well-rounded-man/" target="_blank">A Well-Rounded Man</a>, a guide to building strength, calm, and presence. It includes <a href="https://spike.co.nz/the-swearing-project/" target="_blank">The Swearing Project</a> — a 30-day challenge to help you master the magic pause that changes your life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>100 Hindu Squats a day – Day #1181</li>
  <li>10 Hindu Pushups a day – Day #1099</li>
  <li>Rebounding – Day #67 (great for lymphatic system)</li>
  <li>1 Minute Plank a day – Day #1052</li>
</ul>
<h3>Push-up and Pull-up Ladders 3x per week</h3>
<p>Usually combined with Hindu Squats and Push-ups as a circuit. Each round increases difficulty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 Hindu Squats</li>
  <li>1 Pull-up</li>
  <li>1 Push-up</li>
  <li>10 putts</li>
  <li>5–10 elastic band pulls (with good form)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then rest 30s and increase reps each round. Keep going until your form breaks.I add burpees, shoulder presses and other exercises, but this is my baseline.</p>

<h3>Exercise Tracking</h3>

<p><strong>Added: Jan 2024 – Disc Golf Putting</strong><br>
10 putts per round (at least 50 putts)</p>

<p><strong>Added: April 2024 – Skipping</strong><br>
One minute of skipping before my circuits<br>
<em>Removed: January 2025</em></p>

<p><strong>Added: January 2025 – Rebounding</strong><br>
One minute of rebounding before my circuits</p>


<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Are a great way to get into the habit of doing something when you said you would do it. For example rebounding started with Rebounding for One Minute a Day for 30 Days. As I write this I'm at Day 67. It stuck. Anyone can do something for a minute a day. Find a challenge, track with an app like <a href="https://wayoflifeapp.com/" target="_blank">Way of Life App</a> and you might be shocked what you're doing in a year</p>

<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>Lots of walking and sometimes climbing fences and bush-crashing to find discs. LOL! I go on regular walks and play Disc Golf at courses like Woodhill, Pae O Te Rangi and The Orchard once or twice a week.</p>
